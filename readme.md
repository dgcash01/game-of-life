### Game of Life ###

### Project was written in vanilla javascript.  No need for cumbersome node modules, npm, yarn, or React.

I found this project easiest to write in javascript because I wanted to avoid adding a bunch of packages that would do the work for me.  I wrote a simple algorithm and expanded on the project from there.  

I've added a start and stop feature as well as a pause and step through feature.  Finally I added a speed slider that will allow you to take the game from 1 fps to 100 fps.  

I used HTML canvas element to create a simple board because I wanted a way to simply be able to control the size of my cells.  

One of the first challenges I faced was writting the algorith.  Once I had that down it was just a matter of figuring out how to pause and step through each generation.
